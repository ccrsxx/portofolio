## Overview

As a self-taught fullstack developer, I was always interested in building my own version of popular web applications. Recently, I decided to tackle the challenge of building a Twitter clone using a combination of modern technologies.

## The Tech Stack

For this project, I chose to use the following technologies:

- Next.js for the frontend framework
- TypeScript for static type checking
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Firebase for the backend (database, authentication, and hosting)
- Headless UI for the modal, menu, and popover components
- React Hot Toast for interactive action notifications
- Framer Motion for smooth animations

## Features

I wanted to make sure that my Twitter clone had all the basic features of the real platform, so I implemented the following:

- User authentication (sign up, log in, log out)
- Tweet creation, editing, and deletion
- Like and unlike tweets
- Follow and unfollow users
- View user profiles and tweet lists
- Real-time updates for likes, follows, and tweets
- Infinite scroll for the home timeline and user tweet lists
- Responsive design for mobile devices

Building this project was a great learning experience for me. Here are some of the highlights:

- I started by setting up a Next.js project with TypeScript and installing the necessary dependencies (including Firebase).
- I then set up the Firebase backend, including the Firestore database and authentication system.
- Next, I worked on the user authentication flow for log in and log out. I used Firebase's built-in authentication functions to handle the logic.
- With the authentication system in place, I moved on to the main feature: tweeting. This involved creating a form for creating and editing tweets, as well as displaying a list of tweets on the home timeline and user profiles. I used Firebase onSnapshot listeners to update the data in real time.
- I then added the ability to like and unlike tweets, as well as follow and unfollow users. This required updating the data in the Firestore database and using real-time listeners to trigger updates on the frontend.
- Next, I implemented profile page for user. This involved creating a new page for each user and displaying their tweets, likes, and followers.
- Finally, I worked on the design and polish of the app. I used Tailwind CSS for the basic styles, and Headless UI and Framer Motion for the animations. I also added React Hot Toast for interactive notifications.

## Conclusion

Overall, building this Twitter clone was a rewarding and educational experience. I learned a lot about using Next.js, TypeScript, and Firebase together, as well as various other tools and libraries.
